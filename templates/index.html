{% call tile("How It Works", "how") %}
<p>The Dendrite Network works by logging the voluntary spread of memes
(ideas) and making the log public.  You can watch the growth of the
network through visualizations like the one below.
<p>You have a small circle of contacts that you exchange "bump URLs"
with.  When you visit one of these URLs you have the choice of three
actions:
<ul>
<li><span class="heavy">Forward</span>
<li><span class="heavy">Engage</span>
<li><span class="heavy">Reject</span>
</ul>
<p>Each action is recorded in the public log.
{% endcall %}

{% call tile("Network Spread", "demograph") %}
<p>Click in the graphic below to see a dynamic demonstration of network
growth in action.

<div class="hull"></div>

<p>When you visit a bump URL a link is created on the
graph from your dot to the sender's dot.  When you send bump URLs to
your contacts and they visit them, links are created from those
contacts to you.
<p>
{% endcall %}

{% call tile("Your URL", "ownurl") %}
<p>If you want to participate directly in the network you must pick an
URL to represent yourself.  It can be any URL but if you want to be
contacted then it should obviously include some way of contacting you.
<p>Obvious candidates for avatar URLs would be your facebook or twitter
pages, your blog, your personal homepage, or a specific page you made to
use with the Dendrite Network.
<p>If you aren't concerned about being contacted then you can use a page
from the Wikipedia or something.
<p>(An important point to keep in mind concerning the Dendrite Network is
that you will generally only ever be exchanging memes with people you
know.
<p>All the people in your contacts should be known to you, and you
normally won't exchange information with unknown users.)
