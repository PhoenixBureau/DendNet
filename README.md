Dendrite Network (rewrite to use Flask)

This is a quick rewrite of the https://github.com/calroc/dendrite-network
version to achieve to goals: Use Flask (instead of Django) and "eat my
own dog food" regarding a web app development course I'm putting
together.

I am switching from Django to Flask as a matter of personal preference
and I'll be using this project to try out the framework I'll be teaching.

Testing local commit hook to update local staging server...
