        <p>This page is <em>about</em> the Dendrite Network, to actually <em>use</em> the Dendrite Network go to <a href="http://dendritenetwork.com/">http://dendritenetwork.com/</a></p>

<h3>Behind the Scenes</h3>

<p>If you look at <a href="https://github.com/PhoenixBureau/DendNet">the source code on Github</a> you'll see that the Dendrite Network is actually very simple in operation.  Most of the action takes place in the user's browser, the server is very simple and does little more than save events to a log and the internal database.</p>

<p>This page describes the concepts and operation of the system. If something is unclear after reading this document consider asking about it on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/dendrite-network">Dendrite Network Google Group</a>.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>I created the D.N. to provide a simple convenient way for normal people to earn income from the Internet.  The D.N. itself is a personal project, not a commercial concern, and it will never become commercial.  If it takes off I'll start a non-profit to administer it.</p>

<p>So, if the D.N. is non-commercial, how are people going to use it to earn income?</p>

<h3>How?</h3>

<p>The D.N. forms a neutral <em>platform</em> for specific campaigns people run on top of it.  Anyone with something to sell or promote can use the D.N. to do it and watch the resulting graph of word-of-mouth connection growing in near-real-time.</p>

<p>It is up to the individual campaign-runners to figure out how to reward their network members for spreading the word.  This is just like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo where the project sponsors must create a schema of rewards for their investor/benefactors.</p>
